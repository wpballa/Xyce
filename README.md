# Xyce
Version 7.2 works, just follow the 7.1 instructions changing 7.1 to 7.2. 

Build instructions for Xyce 7.1 on a Raspberry Pi Model 4B with Buster.
It should also work on a model 3B+ or 3B but with longer compile times.

Due to a few bugs in the released version of 7.1, we now have to pull
the source from the git repository. The instructions have changed to 
reflect that.
