# Xyce
Build instructions for Xyce 7.0 on a Raspberry Pi Model 4B with Buster.
It should also work on a model 3B+ or 3B but with longer compile times.

Please stick with version 7.0, version 7.1 won't compile given the changes in the ADMS models, even on a 8GB model 4B. There is hope that this will be resolved by version 7.2
